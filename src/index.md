**The gist of me** is that I'm a generalist designer/developer who likes buildings things for the web, one of the good ones, and you'll *probably* enjoy grabbing a beer or coffee with me.

I've been designing and writing code professionally for almost six years now. That includes dabbling in graphic design, all things front and backend development, consulting, and working with startups.

So far, I've avoided to put myself under one label â€“ to specialise in one thing only â€“ and instead gone for this Jack of all Trades role in the various teams I've had the pleasure of working with.

For university, I studied Software Engineering at Chalmers in Gothenburg, Sweden. Between the classes of data structures and mathematical modeling, I freelanced in web design on the side, while enjoying the joys of student society life. I still look back on my university time as one of the happiest periods of my life.

The consultant life taught me a lot university did not, and I was lucky to get the chance of working with companies like Volvo, SCA, and Sony Ericsson during this period. I still couldn't drop the thought that *"Man, working with a product must be like 1000 times cooler than writing code for corporate clients every day"*.

**This made me get in touch with [Lookback](http://lookback.io).** They had developed this cool user research technology based on screen recordings for iOS (originally sprung from within Spotify), and I felt that they were good people. Don't ask me how I got the job, but after cold mailing with the co-founder, [Jonatan](http://twitter.com/littke), they saw something in me, and I joined in during the summer after taking my Bachelor's degree. I got my hands dirty at once in their Meteor based web app, and step by step built the front and back-end infrastructure that is today's [lookback.io](http://lookback.io).

You'll find some code I've open sourced in Lookback in our [GitHub organization](http://github.com/lookback).

At the end of the summer, I evidently saw something in them as well, since I decided to *not* pursue a Master's degree in Interaction Design â€“ something I had planned on for the past four years â€“ but to instead join Lookback as their first employee.

We've now grown to twelve people, moved the head quarters to San Francisco, and have customers like **Netflix, Facebook, Dropbox, Spotify, and Uber**. I can't really wait to grow us further (even though it's so cozy and nice just being twelve! ðŸ˜­). I'm blessed every single day by working with this [extremely talented group of people](http://lookback.io/about), in the areas of design, engineering, and product.

We don't have set titles in Lookback, and thus I'm having troubles labelling my position â€“ and that's fine. I do a little bit of everything: product, strategy, coding (front and back-end), designing, writing, marketing.

I love traveling. I lived in Canada for a year before university, where I went completely "offline" and worked as a barista. As everybody else, I still damn myself for not picking up more languages when I was younger though.

Since September 2015, I've embarked upon this nomad thing of traveling the world while working remote. It's been eye opening, marveling, and has given me the coolest sense of freedom there is. Keep an eye out on ["Now"](/now) for updates. I've met incredibly cool people on the road so far, everywhere from Madrid to Rio. [Give me a shout](http://twitter.com/johanbrook) if we're in the same city!

Thanks for reading.
