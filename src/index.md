**I like building things** for the web and you'll *probably* enjoy grabbing a beer or coffee with me. I also like reading, writing, strolling around in cities, playing the guitar, coffee, cooking, and photography.

***

I've been designing and writing code for around seven years now. So far, I've avoided to put myself under one label – to specialise in one thing only – and instead gone for this Jack of all Trades role in the various teams I've had the pleasure of working with. I like all things graphic and digital design, front and backend development, product and strategy, typography and API design, copywriting and CSS architecture.

For university, I studied Software Engineering at **Chalmers** in Gothenburg, Sweden. Between the classes of data structures and mathematical modeling, I freelanced in web design on the side, while enjoying the joys of student society life. I still look back on my university time as one of the happiest periods of my life.

During a year, I worked for **Spotify** in their *Street Team*. I was, together with a small group of other awesome students from Stockholm and Linköping, responsible for the university presence of Spotify. We arranged super fun hackathons and other cool events, like [Gothenburg Startup Hack](http://www.gbgstartuphack.com), [Diversify](http://diversify.confetti.events), and [Monkey Music Challenge 2](http://monkey-music-challenge.github.io/). This might have been the most fun "job" I've ever had so far.

The consultant life taught me a lot university did not, and I was lucky to get the chance of working with companies like Volvo, SCA, and Sony Ericsson during this period. I still couldn't drop the thought of that: *"Man, working with a product must be like 1000 times cooler than writing code for corporate clients every day"*.

**This made me get in touch with [Lookback](http://lookback.io).** They had developed this cool user research technology based on screen recordings for iOS (originally sprung from within Spotify), and I felt that they were good people. I got my hands dirty at once in their Meteor based web app, and step by step built the front and back-end infrastructure that is today's [lookback.io](http://lookback.io).

You'll find some code I've open sourced in Lookback in our [GitHub organization](http://github.com/lookback).

At the end of the summer, I evidently saw something in them as well, since I decided to *not* pursue a Master's degree in Interaction Design – something I had planned on for the past four years – but to instead join Lookback as their first employee.

**I love traveling.** I lived in Canada for a year before university, where I went completely offline and worked as a barista. As everybody else, I still hate myself for not picking up more languages when I was younger though.

Since September 2015, I've embarked upon this nomad thing of traveling the world while working remote. So far, I've lived and worked in Vienna, London, San Francisco, New York, Montréal, Asunción, Rio de Janeiro, and Copenhagen.

Thank you so much for reading.
