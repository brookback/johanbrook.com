This page reflects what I'm doing with my life at the moment, since it's the most common question on the internet and in real life anyway.

17. ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª **Stockholm**, Sweden (Spring, 2018)

I spend my time on these things:

- enjoying life with my dope girlfriend in Stockholm.
- working in [Lookback](http://lookback.io) as web app developer and designer. Mostly doing product and writing Javascript in [Meteor](http://meteor.com).
- reading books and articles, in order to get my mind off the digital things.
- currently reading *Sapiens* by Yuval Noah Harari.
- collecting memories on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/johanbrook/).
- playing the guitar.
- writing [open source packages for Meteor](https://atmospherejs.com/lookback/).
- trying to write more articles on this site.
- learning Portuguese via Duolingo and other methods.

If my life changes, I'll update this page.
