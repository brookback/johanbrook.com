This page reflects what I'm doing with my life at the moment, since it's the most common question on the internet and in real life anyway.

**So.**

I've had the privilege of traveling while working remotely (doing this nomad thing). My current travel plans are:

1. ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¹ ~~**Vienna**~~, Austria (October, 2015)
2. ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ ~~**San Francisco**~~, U.S. (October-November, 2015)
3. ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ ~~**London**~~, UK (November-December, 2015)
4. ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡° ~~**Copenhagen**~~, Denmark (December, 2015)
5. ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª ~~**Sweden**~~ (December, 2015)
6. ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ ~~**Madrid**~~, Spain (January)
7. ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¾ ~~**AsunciÃ³n**~~, Paraguay (February-April, *if El NiÃ±o doesn't fuck the country over again*)
8. ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ ~~**San Diego**~~, U.S. (March)
9. ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡· ~~**Rio de Janeiro**~~, Brazil (April-May). View some [photos on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/riosexton/) from me and my friends.
10. ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª ~~**Gothenburg**~~, Sweden (June-September)
11. ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦ ~~**MontrÃ©al**~~, Canada (September-October)
12. ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ ~~**New York**~~, USA (October-December)
13. ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ ~~**Miami/New York**~~, USA (April)
14. ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª **Gothenburg**, Sweden (January-September)
15. ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¹ **Lisbon**, Portugal (Autumn 2017)

I spend my time on these things:

- enjoying life in Gothenburg with friends.
- working in [Lookback](http://lookback.io) as web app developer and designer. Mostly doing product and writing Javascript in [Meteor](http://meteor.com).
- reading books and articles, in order to get my mind off the digital things.
- currently reading *Sapiens* by Yuval Noah Harari.
- collecting memories on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/johanbrook/).
- playing the guitar.
- writing [open source packages for Meteor](https://atmospherejs.com/lookback/).
- trying to write more articles on this site.
- learning Portuguese via Duolingo and other methods.

If my life changes, I'll update this page.
