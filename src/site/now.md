I spend my time on these things:

- enjoying life with my dope girlfriend in Stockholm.
- working in [Lookback](http://lookback.io) as web app developer and designer.
- reading books and articles, in order to get my mind off the digital things.
- currently reading _Rainbow Six_ by Tom Clancy.
- collecting memories on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/johanbrook/).
- playing the guitar.
- trying to write more articles on this site.
- learning Portuguese via Duolingo and other methods.

If my life changes, I'll update this page.
